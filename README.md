# jacobi-iteration-cuda

GPU version of the Jacobi Iteration implemented using both CUDA C++ and PyCUDA

To Run the CUDA C++ solvers:

    1. In a linux terminal, run 'make clean'.

    2. Then run 'make'.
    
    3. Then run './solver_run'.

To Run the PyCuda solver, run the notebook cells sequentially.
